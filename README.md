#### Description:
I created FinanceSG with the aspiration to alleviate the rising cost of living in Singapore. Singaporeans have been trying to stay away from making big-ticket purchases in the recent years due to the ever rising inflation rate. To develop this project,
I have used a mixed of Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc.
While it may be a good sign that we are saving money by avoiding these purchases, I posit that the cause of this does more harm than good. Singaporeans should have the ability to plan their own finances and practice self-discipline rather than
fearing that they might stepped on a loophole.

The vehicle calculator request inputs such as the open market value (OMV), vehicle category, vehicle age and more to provide a good gauge of the total cost required when purchasing a car.

The property calculator requires quite a bit of inforamtion due to the complexitiy of the calculation. Some inforamtion it requires is the status of flat, whether isit still constructing or has it been completed, type of flat, resale levy and more. The
unique feature of this calculator is that it provides a cost breakdown of the inidividual cost involved in my calculation so that users can better understand how I have dervied the cost.

For the income tax calculator, I have outsourced it to official authorities excel sheet. This is because I realised that I needed information that was not readily available and there weren't any APIs available.

The university calculator provides the same functionality as other calculators. Some infomation required includes the tuition fees and whether the student has any loans or scholarships. I have provided a list of tuition fees at the bottom of the page so
that users can reference to it if unsure of their course's tuition fees.

Lastly, the budget planner takes in information such as whether the user has any maintainance and their monthly income. By using information such as their income and expense, the calculator provides feedback as to whether their respective expenses fall
within the healthy range w.r.t Singapore's average and financial advior's advices. Additionally, it provides some useful tips as to how users should allocation their income. It also has some good challenges and habits that are proven through research
to help people save more money.

Overall, FinanceSG has the goal of providing knowledge and advice to Singaporeans on making their big-ticket purchases. Hope everyone has enjoyed it!
